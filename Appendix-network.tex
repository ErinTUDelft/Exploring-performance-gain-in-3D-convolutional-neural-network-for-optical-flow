The network is a neural network built for estimating optical flow, it takes as input 2 (positive and negative polarity) images. The magnitude at each location is generally 1, but can also be 2 or 3. The input is passed through layer e1, which contains 16 convolution kernels, with a stride of 2 (halving the output dimension to 64x64). Then in layer e2, 32 kernels are present, again with a stride of 2 (halving again the output dimension, now to 32x32), then d2 consists of 32 kernels with a stride of 1. This is then interpolated back to the output of e1 (64x64). This layer is the concatenated with the output of e1, thus containing 32+16=48 channels. This layer is then interpolated to the original dimension, and concatenated with the input. Finally, a prediction layer is present.
